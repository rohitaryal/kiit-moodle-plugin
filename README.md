## KIIT Moodle Plugin 🎲
 Plugins support for KIIT moodle to optimize your performance.

 ☢️ **DESCLAIMER:** Cheating is bad like really. This project doesn's support cheating nor cheaters 🫵. It merely exists to show common vulnerabilities and flaw in moodle, for experimenting purpose and as my scripting practice. This script is provided "as is" without any warranties, express or implied. The author takes no responsibility for any consequences resulting from the use of this script. Use it at your own risk. It is recommended to test this script in a review mode and not on a real test/quizzes. By using this script, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to this disclaimer. 💯

 ### 🤌 Installation:
 1. **Install a userscript-manager** (*any one*)

    - ![Chrome](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alrra/browser-logos/main/src/chrome/chrome_16x16.png) [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) or
    - ![Firefox](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alrra/browser-logos/main/src/firefox/firefox_16x16.png) [Tampermonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/) or
    - ![Edge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alrra/browser-logos/main/src/edge/edge_16x16.png) [Tampermonkey](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/tampermonkey/dhhkcnkncnogfoefnondnaogonpedlnh) or
    - ![Safari](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alrra/browser-logos/main/src/safari/safari_16x16.png) [Tampermonkey](https://apps.apple.com/app/tampermonkey/id1482490089) or

    > I recommend using tampermonkey to prevent any api issues (*untested*).

2. **And install the script** (*from any one*)
    - ![Greasy Fork](https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?sz=16&domain=greasyfork.org) [Greasyfork.org](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/485024-kiit-moodle) or
